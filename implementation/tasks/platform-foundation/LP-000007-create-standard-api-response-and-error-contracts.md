- `services/api/src/shared/errors/**`

## 8. Out of Scope

- `module-specific business errors`

## 9. Required Documents

- `MIP-000-platform-foundation.md`
- `51-engineering-implementation-guide.md`
- `52-repository-structure.md`
- `54-agent-development-plan.md`
- `55-module-definition-of-done.md`

- relevant accepted ADRs

## 10. Knowledge Package

Platform Foundation Knowledge Package from `MIP-000-platform-foundation.md`.

## 11. Dependencies

Dependencies must be identified before this task moves to `READY`.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

- Success and error envelopes match MIP-000.
- Typed error categories exist.
- HTTP mapping is centralized.
- Raw infrastructure errors are not exposed.

## 13. Mandatory Tests

- contract tests
- safe error mapping tests

## 14. Required Reviewers

- Solution Architect where architecture is affected
- QA
- Security where security or credentials are affected
- DevOps where CI, environments or infrastructure are affected
- Documentation reviewer where documentation changes

## 15. Expected Deliverables

- implementation or review summary;
- changed or reviewed files;
- tests added;
- tests executed;
- test results;
- risks;
- known limitations;
- rollback or recovery instructions;
- documentation updates;
- Definition of Done evidence;
- readiness recommendation.

## 16. Rollback Expectation

The change must be reversible through configuration rollback, code rollback, migration recovery or forward fix as appropriate. Immutable migration history must not be rewritten.

## 17. Completion Rule

The task may be marked complete only when all acceptance criteria and mandatory tests pass and required review evidence exists.
