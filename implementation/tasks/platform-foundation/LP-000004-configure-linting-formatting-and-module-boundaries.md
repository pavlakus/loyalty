- `52-repository-structure.md`
- `54-agent-development-plan.md`
- `55-module-definition-of-done.md`
- `57-agent-prompts.md`

- relevant accepted ADRs

## 10. Knowledge Package

Platform Foundation Knowledge Package from `MIP-000-platform-foundation.md`.

## 11. Dependencies

Dependencies must be identified before this task moves to `READY`.

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

- Formatting and lint commands run from root.
- Private cross-module imports are rejected.
- Circular dependencies are detected.
- Generated code paths are handled explicitly.

## 13. Mandatory Tests

- lint pass
- forbidden import test
- circular dependency test

## 14. Required Reviewers

- Solution Architect where architecture is affected
- QA
- Security where security or credentials are affected
- DevOps where CI, environments or infrastructure are affected
- Documentation reviewer where documentation changes

## 15. Expected Deliverables

- implementation or review summary;
- changed or reviewed files;
- tests added;
- tests executed;
- test results;
- risks;
- known limitations;
- rollback or recovery instructions;
- documentation updates;
- Definition of Done evidence;
- readiness recommendation.

## 16. Rollback Expectation

The change must be reversible through configuration rollback, code rollback, migration recovery or forward fix as appropriate. Immutable migration history must not be rewritten.

## 17. Completion Rule

The task may be marked complete only when all acceptance criteria and mandatory tests pass and required review evidence exists.
